# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description
I wanted to make this webpage to be able to easily remind myself and other students of commands and prompts throughout our bootcamp journey. This build will help with some important sections that are used every day. It solves trying to search everywhere for a solution to a problem. Through making this I was able to learn more about how to properly code in phrases and sentences to display the site in a way that makes sense.
